## Project Steps

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Feature engineering
   - Handling missing values
   - Feature encoding and standardization

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Univariate analysis
   - Bivariate analysis
   - Multivariate analysis

3. **Data Modeling**
   - K-Means Clustering
   - Elbow Method for optimal cluster selection
   - Evaluation using Silhouette Score and PCA

4. **Customer Segmentation Analysis**
   - Identification of 4 distinct customer clusters
   - Detailed analysis of each cluster's characteristics

5. **Insights and Recommendations**
   - Key insights from clustering analysis
   - Actionable recommendations for marketing strategies

## Key Findings

- Age and life stage significantly influence customer behavior across clusters.
- Income levels correlate with spending patterns and campaign responsiveness.
- Web engagement doesn't always translate to higher purchase rates or spending.
- Education levels vary across clusters but don't directly correlate with spending.
- Marital status and the presence of children appear to influence customer behavior.

## Recommendations

- Develop age-specific marketing campaigns and product offerings.
- Tailor pricing strategies and product ranges to each cluster's income level.
- Optimize the website to convert high engagement into sales, especially for younger clusters.
- Adjust communication styles and product information to suit each cluster's education level.
- Develop products and services that cater to different family structures.
- Implement cross-cluster strategies to move customers up to higher-value clusters.
- Focus on increasing customer lifetime value for each cluster.
